HFI also announced that the product would be available for a limited time only, sending Tasteemix enthusiasts from Argentina to\u00c2\u00b7 Zambia into a buying frenzy. \n All six major grocery distributors here in Mauritius confirmed that they had received a large supply of coconut cream Tasteemix shortly after the new product was introduced on 8 January. - [2] -. Both wholesalers expected it to be gone by the end of the day. \n \"HFI's current campaign is reminiscent of the one it waged four years ago when it introduced its strawberry-cinnamon cereal,\"said Bina Perida, a professor of marketing at Port Louis Business College. \"Then, as now, HFI announced a product as being offered for a limited time only, resulting in that item's rapid disappearance from shelves in grocery stores across the globe.\" - [3] -. \n On 5 April, HFI's accountants will review the company's first-quarter earnings. \n Based on the initial sales, market watchers are confident that HFI's expectations will be met. -[4]-. \n ",
