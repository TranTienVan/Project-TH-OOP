They are made of large rafts of either bamboo or timber depending on the capabilities of the fish raisers. In most cases, they are timber rafts measuring about 12 by 5 metres and 3 metres in height. After five months -- the usual time for the fish to complete their life cycle -- the family of the fish raiser anchors the raft on some part of the Ti\u1ec1n, H\u1eadu, or Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c rivers or any major canals. At present, most districts in ", "AnGiang such as Long Xuy\u00ean, Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c, Ch\u1ee3 M\u1edbi, Ph\u00fa T\u00e2n, Ph\u00fa Ch\u00e2u and Ch\u00e2u Ph\u00fa raise caged fish, but this occupation is still essentially practised in C\u1ed3n Ti\u00ean village, Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c township. C\u1ed3n Ti\u00ean has the advantage of being located near the supply centre for young fish and fish meal (the Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c market) and also on a fast-flowing river. C\u1ed3n Ti\u00ean actually accounts for almost half of all the fish rafts of ", "AnGiang", " province.", "The two main fish species raised in cages in ", "AnGiang are the Ba Sa and Chai which take their food from the water surface. Their food consists chiefly of rice bran mixed with vegetables such as pumpkin.", "A raft for rearing 50,000 Ba Sa fish needs about 3,500 kilograms of food, but for rearing 10,000 to 20,000 Chai, only 700 to 800 kilos of food are required. One raft needs only three workhands. The first harvest from a raft averages 12 tonnes of Ba Sa and three tonnes of he or Chai fish. Net profit may account for 25 % - 30 % of the proceeds.", "But not everything has been plain sailing for the fish raisers of ", "AnGiang. At its peak year, AnGiang had 1,200 rafts. In 1971, there were only 662 and the number slumped to 225 in 1980. A rapid recovery began in 1984, when the local government decreed new policies on prices and on the rearing and marketing of caged fish. Early in 1990, the ", "AnGiang Aquatic Produce Import- Export Company loaned fish raisers three billion dong. It also found markets for caged fish in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Subsequently, the number of rafts rose to 715 and fish output to 14,000 tonnes, double the figures for 1989. The expansion also provided jobs for 4,000 people.", "One of the biggest problems in caged fish raising in ", "AnGiang is the supply of young fish, since most of them come from natural breeding. Production of all other fish still depends on natural breeding. Research and experimentation in this direction with regard to fish such as Ba Sa, Chai and Bong are going on at the provincial sciences committee. In recent years, caged fish raising has also been undertaken by other provinces such as ", "H\u00e0 T\u00e2y, H\u00e0 B\u1eafc and V\u0129nh Ph\u00fa in the north and H\u1eadu Giang, ", "\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p and Long An in the south. In H\u00e0 T\u00e2y province west of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, 200 families in the district of Ba V\u00ec, Dan Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng and M\u1ef9 \u0110\u1ee9c keep more than 200 fish cages along the \u0110\u00e0 and Red Rivers. Ba V\u00ec district alone has 165 cages, mainly raising Indian carp. They yield from two to three tonnes of fish per cage. On average, the fish raisers get from 16 to 24 million dong in income and about seven million in net profit. Riverside villages such as Thuan My, Tay Dang, Co Do and Minh Ch\u00e2u are gradually shifting from fishing in the river to raising fish in cages. The administration in Ba V\u00ec has made a uniform loan of one million dong to every family of fish raisers. Experts are providing technical assistance to make fish spawn in the rivers, thus reducing production costs. Many families of farmers are also raising fish as a secondary occupation besides cultivation. One thousand families of farmers in Ba V\u00ec district have registered for caged fish raising. (VNS)"]},

National Construction and Defence for National Independence lasted about one thousand years (from the early 10th Century to the middle of the 19th Century). This period also witnessed several fierce struggles launched by the Vietnamese people against the northern aggressors. The wars of resistance included the battle against the T\u1ed1ng army in the 11th century, three separate wars against the invading Mongol army in the 13rd century, and the resistance against the Minh army in the 14th century. In the late 17th century, the Vietnamese feudal nation was faced with a social and economic crisis that led to an annexation of the country into two parts. However, the victory of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n revolt at the close of the 18th century reunified the country. In the first half of the 19th century, the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty continued to consolidate national unification. Yet, a prevailing conservative attitude among Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty court officials allowed the country to drift into a period of stagnation and Vietnam eventually became a French colony. In 1930, the Communist Party of Vietnam was founded. The Party led the Vietnamese people to a revolutionary victory in August 1945. After that, there were two resistance wars against the old- and the neo-colonialist powers. The first resistance war ended with a resounding victory at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 in May 1954. The second resistance war came to an end following the historic H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh military campaign which led to the great victory achieved in the spring of 1975.

Thirty years of war have inflicted serious damage on these monuments. Some have been almost completely destroyed like the old citadel at ", "Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb in Central Vietnam. Others were heavily damaged such as many temples, pagodas, churches and other places of worship in northern Vietnam. Nature has also taken its toll. Conservation work has been compounded by growing appropriation of public lands by people for house construction, especially in the towns.

In 1990, the government spent 500 million dong on restoration. For this year, 800 million dong has been earmarked. Conservationists are all interested in preserving original features.

", "One major problem is the destruction caused by termites to iron-wood pillars in temples and pagodas. Vietnamese restorers have found a solution by drawing upon the experience of builders in the past. A common method is either to fill hollowed-out pillars with concrete or to replace them with new ones. But both have their drawbacks. In the first case, the concrete would detach from the wood within a few years. In the latter case, the cost involved and the risk of collapse during the replacement would be high.", "To solve the problem, Vietnamese restorers have combined the use of traditional termite killers with the spraying of chemicals into the infested pillars. That would both kill the insects and prevent the growth of fungi. They can gnaw away each year from 0.2mm to 0.5mm of wood. But what is more damaging is that the humid secretion they leave on the surface will create the necessary environment for the development of fungi. This damage can be best seen at Keo Pagoda in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh province, 100 km southeast of ", "H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, where several hundred iron-wood pillars have been virtually eaten up.

Since 1991, the local authorities have spent dozens of millions of dong on repairing the Temple of Literature, the first national university where 82 stone stelas can be found on which the names of 1,234 laureates of successive examinations in the feudal times are recorded. Cost of the whole project is estimated at 12 billion dong, or about 1 million dollars.
